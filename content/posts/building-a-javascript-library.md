In the [Building a Knockout paging plugin]({{< ref "/posts/building-a-knockout-paging-plugin" >}}) post, we developed a Knockout paging plugin using JavaScript. However, writing the software itself was just one step in building the library.

In a series of seven blog posts, we will look at all the other steps we took when developing our JavaScript library. These include automating tasks, open-sourcing our code, adding package manager support, using a build server to automatically build (and test) our software, supporting TypeScript and adding our library to a CDN.

Programming languages and their design have always been one of my favorite topics. In this series of blog posts, we'll build our own JSON query language that is inspired heavily by the [jq language](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

## Language specification

## Lexer

TODO: difference lexer/tokenizer

## Superpower

https://github.com/datalust/superpower
https://github.com/sprache/Sprache

## Conclusion

TODO

In the [next post]({{< ref "/posts/building-a-json-query-language-part-2-parser" >}}), we'll build on our lexer and parse the tokens into a structure that describes code in our language.

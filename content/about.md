My name is Erik Schierboom and I'm a full-stack software developer from The Netherlands. Writing software is probably my greatest passion! I have written software in many languages, but I'm particularly fond of C#, F# and Kotlin. Most applications I have written were web applications, though I have also created mobile apps.

Besides writing software, I have a passion for sharing knowledge. As such, I'm mentoring the C# and F# tracks on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/profiles/ErikSchierboom), posting on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2071395/erik-schierboom), creating [demo applications and libraries](https://github.com/ErikSchierboom/) and writing [blog posts](/posts/). I'm also a member of the [.NET foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/), [have been interviewed on exercism.io](https://exercism.io/blog/interview-with-erik-schierboom) and have done a guest lecture or two.

### Work

I am currently working at [Exercism](https://exercism.io/team/staff). If you want to know more about my professional career, please visit my [LinkedIn page](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/erikschierboom).

### Hobbies

When I am not programming, you can find me playing on the PS4, reading a book, watching a movie/series or listening to some music.
